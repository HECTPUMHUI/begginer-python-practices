# None : This is a special constant used to denote a null value or a void. 
# Its important to remember, 0,
#  any empty container(e.g empty list) do not compute to None.
# It is an object of its datatype – NoneType. 
# It is not possible to create multiple None objects and can 
# assign them to variables.

# and : This a logical operator in python. “and” Return the first false value .
# if not found return last

# showing that None is not equal to 0 
# prints False as its false.
